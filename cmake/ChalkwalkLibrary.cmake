# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Where the shared libraries come from.
#
# Unset, nothing changes: this repository's submodules are used and a fresh
# clone builds with no extra steps. The submodule stays the source of truth for
# WHICH commit this project wants.
#
# CHALKWALK_MUSIC_DIR, CHALKWALK_DSP_DIR, CHALKWALK_NINJAM_DIR -- cache
# variables or environment variables -- point at working checkouts instead,
# which is what makes a change to a library testable HERE without a commit and
# without a push:
#
#     cmake -B build -DCHALKWALK_MUSIC_DIR=$HOME/Programming/chalkwalk-music
#
# This project then compiles that working tree directly. Edit there, rebuild
# here, run the suite; no round trip through GitHub. That matters most for the
# library that is still growing: a change to `Harmony` wants the bots' own
# assertions run against it before it is committed anywhere.
#
# THE SUBMODULE SHA NO LONGER DESCRIBES WHAT YOU BUILT while one of these is
# set, which is the whole cost of it. CI must not use them, and neither should
# anything whose result is meant to be attributable, since a number that cannot
# name the commit that produced it is not a measurement. Use an override to
# iterate; bump the submodule and re-verify before calling anything done.
#
# Same shape as Anvil's CHALKWALK_PHYSICAL_DIR, deliberately: one pattern
# across the ecosystem is worth more than a better one used in one place.

    # the build, and the inner one is not consulted at all -- so a nested
    # library does not need its own submodules checked out.
